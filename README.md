# Debugging Tips

A large part of a software developers job is to find problems. To find problems in existing applications and to minimize problems in applications.

In this session we will look at tips, tricks and techniques for tracking down problems in our applications.

## We will look at:
* How to track down errors
* Analyzing stack traces
* Isolating an issue
* Debugging tools

## How to track down errors:
* Understanding the big picture
* What areas in the application are error prone
* What clues do we have?
* How to read error messages

## Analyzing stack traces:
* Which code is yours?
* At which line is the error?
* Why could things go wrong at that line?
* Silent failure?

## Isolating an issue:
* Remove code - check if it still fails
* Put code back until the error happens again
* Look at lines before & after the problem

## Debugging tools
* Chrome developer tools - break points
* print things to the console.
* break problem down into components
* use log files - with various log levels
